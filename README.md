Express.js Setting up mongoose

We dont to create a centralized code file database.js for mongoose unlinke other stuff like myql2,sequelize,mongodb....etc which makes it very easy to use as mongoose automatically manages the connection pool automatically in the background and all we need to do is import mangodb in the app.js and then register it there.

Check app.js for more info....
